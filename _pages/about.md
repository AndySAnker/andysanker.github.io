Dr Andy S. Anker is a postdoctoral researcher at [DTU Energy](https://www.energy.dtu.dk/), Technical University of Denmark. He currently holds visiting positions at the University of Oxford and Somerville College, Oxford, where he serves as a Fulford Junior Research Fellow. Dr Anker was awarded a 4 million DKK Novo Nordisk Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship to establish a self-driving laboratory aimed at the controlled synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials, operating at the intersection of materials chemistry, machine learning (ML), and robotics for sustainable applications.

In recognition of his pioneering contributions, Dr Anker was selected for [Forbes' "30 Under 30 Europe" in Science & Healthcare (2024)](https://www.forbes.com/profile/andy-sode-anker/), received the [Danish Scattering Society’s PhD Award (2024)](https://xnovotech.com/xnovo-phd-prizes-awarded-at-danscatt-2024/), and was honoured with the [Inflection 2025 Award](https://inflectionaward.com/), identifying him among the top 30 PhDs globally addressing climate change challenges.

His research integrates advanced X-ray scattering techniques, including total scattering with pair distribution function analysis, and small-angle X-ray scattering, with state-of-the-art ML methods for structural characterisation and analysis. Dr Anker collaborates extensively with leading researchers in the fields of automation (Prof. Kasper Støy @ IT University of Copenhagen), nanoparticle synthesis (Assist. Prof. Jonathan Quinson @ Aarhus University), ML-driven atomistic modelling (Assoc. Prof. Volker Deringer @ University of Oxford), ML-analysis of scattering and spectroscopy data (Assoc. Prof. Keith Butler @ University College London), and SDLs for sustanable materials (Prof. Tejs Vegge @ the CAPeX Centre at DTU).

Dr Anker obtained his PhD in Materials Chemistry from the [Nanostructure Group UPCH](https://nanostructure-cph.com/), University of Copenhagen, supervised by Assoc. Prof. [Kirsten Marie Ørnsbjerg Jensen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0LD11kYAAAAJ&hl=da&oi=ao), focusing on nanoparticle structure analysis in solution using combined PDF and SAXS techniques and advanced computational modelling in Python. During his doctoral studies, he collaborated extensively with Assist. Prof. [Raghavendra Selvan](https://raghavian.github.io/) on developing ML tools to analyse chemical data and spent six months at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK, working with Assoc. Prof. [Keith Tobias Butler](https://mdi-group.github.io/) and the Scientific Machine Learning Group.

I have recently been awarded a 4 000 000 DKK (~ £500 000) postdoctoral grant to pursue an academic career in the interface of materials chemistry, machine learning and robotics. Here, I am building a self-driving laboratory for controlled synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials in collaboration with Prof. Tejs Vegge and the [CAPeX center](https://capex.dtu.dk/) at Technical University of Denmark, Assoc. Prof. [Volker Deringer's group](https://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/people/volker-deringer) at Oxford University and Prof. [Kasper Støy's group](https://pure.itu.dk/da/persons/kasper-st%C3%B8y) at the IT University of Copenhagen. In 2024+2025, I am physically working from Oxford.

I obtained my PhD in materials chemistry from the [Nanostructure Group UPCH](https://nanostructure-cph.com/), University of Copenhagen, supervised by Assoc. Prof. [Kirsten Marie Ørnsbjerg Jensen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0LD11kYAAAAJ&hl=da&oi=ao), where my main interest was to study nanoparticles and structures in solution with Total X-ray Scattering with Pair Distribution Function (PDF) and Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). I applied advanced computer modelling, in Python, to combine information of both the local order from PDF and the particle order from SAXS, which overcome problems that the methods cannot overcome individually. 
During my career, the research focus has converged towards developing machine learning (ML) methods to analyse chemical data; especially PDF & SAXS, after I met Assistant Professor [Raghavendra Selvan](https://raghavian.github.io/) who I had collaborated with since 2019. I have furthermore spent 6 months during my PhD working at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory with Senior Lecturer [Keith Tobias Butler](https://mdi-group.github.io/) and the Scientific Machine Learning Group to develop an general approach to match simulated and experimental data in materials chemistry. During the last period of my PhD, I have especially focused on using generative models to analyse scattering-, and spectroscopy data.
